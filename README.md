Description:

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of installing and configuring an Apache web server on an Amazon EC2 instance using Terraform. We'll utilize Terraform's provisioner "file" and "remote-exec" features to automate the entire setup, from deploying the instance to installing and configuring Apache.


What You'll Learn:

1. How to set up an EC2 instance using Terraform.
2. How to use Terraform provisioners to install and configure software on your EC2 instance.
3. How to use the remote-exec provisioner to execute commands on your EC2 instance after it is deployed.
4. How to verify that Apache is installed and serving web content.
